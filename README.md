## Challenge
The challenge is transitioning from the traditional paper format to using mobile devices or computers. How can I ensure that users can seamlessly transition from paper without any noticeable disruptions? I need to make the form as close to paper-like as possible and design it to be extremely user-friendly. This involves creating a data entry form with only one button, which is the button to generate the QR code.

## Role
I was tasked with creating a form using HTML and then converting the data into a QR code. This QR code would allow caretakers to scan and display the entered information. I modeled the form after a paper version, developed it into an application where users can input data, created a button to generate the QR code, and then shared this app with another developer who would facilitate the scanning and displaying of the barcode within the Power App.

## Tools
